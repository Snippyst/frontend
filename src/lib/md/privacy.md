**Content Delivery Network (Cloudflare)**

Our website uses Cloudflare as a content delivery network (CDN) and proxy service. Cloudflare acts as an intermediary between your browser and our servers, caching website content and providing performance optimization. Your IP address may be logged by Cloudflare for abuse prevention, DDoS mitigation, and security purposes. Cloudflare is a US-based company with data centers globally. For details on Cloudflare's privacy practices, visit: https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/

**Important Note:** All your personal data and code snippets are stored on netcup's servers in Europe, not on Cloudflare. Cloudflare only handles the delivery of our website content.

**JavaScript Libraries (jsDelivr)**

Snippyst uses jsDelivr, a global content delivery network, to serve JavaScript libraries and other frontend assets. jsDelivr may record your IP address and basic request information as part of their CDN operations. jsDelivr is operated by a community project and may collect limited technical data.

**Contact Submissions**

When you contact us through our contact emails, we collect your name, email address, and message. This information is sent to our email inboxes, which are hosted within the European Union by Strato, a German company. The E-Mails get relayed through Cloudflare. Cloudflare may log your IP address and other technical data as described above.

To avoid going through Cloudflare, you can send us an email via the email address listed in the Imprint section of our website.

Messages may be retained in our inboxes indefinitely. You can request deletion of your message after we've responded to and resolved your inquiry.

**Disclaimer for External Links**

Snippyst may contain links to external websites and third-party services not operated by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, content, or security of these external sites. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any external services before providing your personal information.

**Disclaimer for User-Contributed Content**

You are solely responsible for any code snippets, files, or other content you upload to Snippyst. You must ensure that your content complies with all applicable laws and does not infringe on third-party rights. We do not endorse, verify, or assume responsibility for user-contributed content. Do not upload sensitive personal information, confidential business data, or information belonging to others without proper authorization.
