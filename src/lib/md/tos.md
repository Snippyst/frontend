## The Snippyst Terms of Service

Effective date: October 26, 2025

## A. Definitions

**Short version:** _We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information._

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with Snippyst.
1. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the Snippyst Privacy Statement, available at [snippyst.com/privacy](https://snippyst.com/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.
1. “Snippyst,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Snippyst.
1. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Snippyst, including any Beta Previews.
1. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
1. The “Website” refers to Snippyst’s website located at [Snippyst.com](https://Snippyst.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by Snippyst at or through the Website. It also refers to Snippyst-owned subdomains of Snippyst.com.

## B. Account Terms

**Short version:** _A human must create your Account; you must be 18 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure._

### 1. Account Controls

- Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.

### 2. Required Information

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process, trough an OAuth provider such as GitHub or Discord, and to maintain your Account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form. You also agree to update your information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or Snippyst has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, Snippyst has the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).

### 3. Account Requirements

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on Snippyst's Service.

- You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
- A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
- One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
- You must be age 18 or older.
- Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
- You may not use Snippyst in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction.

### 4. Account Security

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service.

- You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. Snippyst cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

## C. Acceptable Use

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

## D. User-Generated Content

**Short version:** _You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to._

### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### 2. Snippyst May Remove Content

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or Snippyst terms or policies. User-Generated Content displayed on Snippyst Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Snippyst Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Snippyst the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### 4. License Grant to Us

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant Snippyst the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant Snippyst the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content.

### 5. License Grant to Other Users

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By publishing a snippet, you agree to allow others to view and use that snippet. For additional information read the Disclaimer when creating a new snippet.

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of Snippyst a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Snippyst Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Snippyst as permitted through Snippyst's functionality. You may grant further rights if you adopt a license.
The license is not allowed to restrict the users rights in any way, including rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Content, even for commercial purposes. If you do not want to grant these rights to other Snippyst Users, you must not post the Content publicly on Snippyst.
If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Snippyst Users.

### 6. Contributions Under Repository License

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### 7. Moral Rights

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Snippyst the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

### 8. Access Reciprocity

By using automated means to access, collect, or otherwise use (“Access”) any publicly accessible Content from the Service for the purpose of developing or training any commercially available artificial intelligence model, machine learning system, or similar technology (a "Commercial AI System"), you hereby waive any and all policies, terms, conditions, or contractual provisions governing products, services, websites or datasets you own or operate that would otherwise prohibit, restrict, or place conditions upon Snippyst's Access to any publicly accessible data, information or content associated with your products or services, including for the purpose of developing or training any Commercial AI System. You further agree not to impose technical or other targeted measures to restrict or retaliate against such Access.

This Section D.8 does not apply to Access solely for the purpose of academic research or if, on the date you Access the Content, the number of monthly active users of the products or services made available by you is less than 700 million in the preceding calendar month. For the purposes of this Section, "you" shall refer to you and any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you (affiliates).

## F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us.
If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on Snippyst violates your rights, please contact us via or by emailing. Please view the Imprint to do so. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts that are infringers.

The DMCA provides two simple, straightforward procedures that all Snippyst users should know about: (i) a takedown-notice procedure for copyright holders to request that content be removed; and (ii) a counter-notice procedure for users to get content re-enabled when content is taken down by mistake or misidentification.

DMCA takedown notices are used by copyright owners to ask Snippyst to take down content they believe to be infringing. If you are a software designer or developer, you create copyrighted content every day. If someone else is using your copyrighted content in an unauthorized manner on Snippyst, you can send us a DMCA takedown notice to request that the infringing content be changed or removed.

On the other hand, counter notices can be used to correct mistakes. Maybe the person sending the takedown notice does not hold the copyright or did not realize that you have a license or made some other mistake in their takedown notice. Since Snippyst usually cannot know if there has been a mistake, the DMCA counter notice allows you to let us know and ask that we put the content back up.

The DMCA notice and takedown process should be used only for complaints about copyright infringement. Notices sent through our DMCA process must identify copyrighted work or works that are allegedly being infringed. The process cannot be used for other complaints, such as complaints about alleged trademark infringement or sensitive data; we offer separate processes for those situations.

The DMCA framework is a bit like passing notes in class. The copyright owner hands Snippyst a complaint about a user. If it's written correctly, we pass the complaint along to the user. If the user disputes the complaint, they can pass a note back saying so. Snippyst exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury.

The DMCA process must include the following:

- A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
- Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
- Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Snippyst to locate the material;
- Information reasonably sufficient to permit Snippyst to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;
- A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

If you have this information, please send your DMCA notice via the mail address provided in the Imprint.

## H. API Terms

You may not use the Snippyst API or any other Snippyst-provided interface to collect data from the Service for the purpose of building or improving a commercially available artificial intelligence model, machine learning system, or similar technology (a "Commercial AI System") without our prior written consent. You agree not to impose technical or other targeted measures to restrict or retaliate against Snippyst's access to any publicly accessible data, information or content associated with your products or services, including for the purpose of developing or training any Commercial AI System.

## M. Communications with Snippyst

**Short version:** _We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users._

### 1. Electronic Communication Required

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

## P. Release and Indemnification

**Short version:** _You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved._
